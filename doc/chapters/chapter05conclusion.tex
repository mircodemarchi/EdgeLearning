The correct behavior of a neural network during the training phase is given by the loss. In a given training step, if the loss is less than or equal to the loss of the previous step then the neural network is working correctly.

The implementation produced was tested with a small dataset and on small neural networks, in order to keep track of the variation of the weights during the training phase. With the passage of the benches and the epochs during the training phase, the loss of the neural networks is lowered or remain constant consequently the training works. In addition, in the most cases, 100\% accuracy is achieved on the training data. In particular, the best results are produced by the RNN.

Further details of testing, profiling and examples will be reported here.
